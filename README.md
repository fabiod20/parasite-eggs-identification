# Parasite Eggs Identification
This repository contains the solution proposed for the third Mini-Contest of the **Data Mining** course of *University of Naples Federico II*.
You can find more about the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/unina-data-mining-2021-minicontest-n3/overview).

The contest aims at the detection of parasite eggs in microscopic images. The task is to determine whether a parasite egg appears or not in a given image.

The solution shown in the Notebook, implemented by means of *PyTorch*, is made up of tree main stages:
- **Data understanding**: extract some useful information from the training images.
- **Data preparation**: prepare data for the next stage.
- **Modeling**: deep learning approaches were used to face the problem, such as *Convolutional Neural Network* (CNN).
- **Evaluation**: evaluating models' performance.
